#### Steps to Run `agents-json` Against an App Providing a RESTful Objects API

To run `agents-json` against an application that provides a RESTful Objects API, you need to ensure that the application is properly set up to expose its API and that `agents-json` is configured to interact with it. Here are the steps:

---

### **1. Ensure the RESTful Objects API is Running**
- Confirm that the application exposing the RESTful Objects API is up and running.
- Verify the base URL of the API (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api`) and ensure it is accessible.
- Check that the API adheres to RESTful principles and supports JSON as the data format for requests and responses.

---

### **2. Install and Set Up `agents-json`**
- If `agents-json` is a tool or library, ensure it is installed on your system. For example, if it is a Node.js-based tool, you might install it using:
  ```bash
  npm install -g agents-json
  ```
- Refer to the documentation of `agents-json` to understand its configuration requirements.

---

### **3. Configure `agents-json`**
- Provide the base URL of the RESTful Objects API to `agents-json`. This might involve creating a configuration file or passing the URL as a command-line argument.
- If authentication is required by the API, include the necessary credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) in the configuration.

---

### **4. Define the JSON Schema or Input**
- If `agents-json` requires a specific JSON schema or input file to interact with the API, prepare this file. For example:
  ```json
  {
    "endpoint": "/objects",
    "method": "GET",
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
  }
  ```
- This schema should match the structure of the API endpoints and the expected request/response formats.

---

### **5. Run `agents-json`**
- Execute the `agents-json` tool against the API. For example:
  ```bash
  agents-json --config config.json
  ```
- Replace `config.json` with the path to your configuration file.

---

### **6. Validate the Output**
- Check the output of `agents-json` to ensure it is interacting correctly with the API.
- If there are errors, debug by reviewing the API logs and the configuration of `agents-json`.

---

### **7. Automate or Integrate**
- If `agents-json` is part of a larger workflow, integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline or automation scripts for continuous testing or monitoring of the RESTful Objects API.

By following these steps, you can successfully run `agents-json` against an application providing a RESTful Objects API. Let me know if you need further clarification!
